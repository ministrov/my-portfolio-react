    title: "How do solar panels work?",
    description: `
       Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity
       using photovoltaic (PV) cells. When sunlight hits the cells,
       it creates an electric field that generates direct current (DC)
       electricity. This DC electricity is then converted to
       alternating current (AC) electricity using an inverter, making
       it usable for your home or business.

    title: "What are the benefits of installing solar panels?",
    description: `
       Installing solar panels can reduce or eliminate your
       electricity bills, increase the value of your property,
       decrease your carbon footprint, and provide a renewable
       source of energy. Additionally, many regions offer incentives
       and rebates for solar installations.

    title: "How much does a solar power system cost?",
    description: `
      The cost of a solar power system varies depending on the size of
       the system, the type of equipment used, and your location. On
       average, a residential solar panel system can range from $15,000
       to $25,000 before incentives and rebates.

    title: "How long will it take for my solar panels to pay for themselves?",
    description: `
    The payback period for solar panels typically ranges from 6 to 10 years,
    depending on factors such as your energy usage, the cost of electricity
    in your area, and the available financial incentives.

    title: "Will my solar panels work during a power outage?",
    description: `
      Most grid-tied solar power systems will not function during a power
      outage for safety reasons unless they are paired with a battery
       storage system or a solar generator that allows for off-grid
       operation.

    title: "How much maintenance do solar panels require?",
    description: `
    Solar panels require minimal maintenance. Regular cleaning to remove dust,
    dirt, and debris, as well as periodic inspections to ensure everything is
    functioning properly, is generally sufficient. Most panels come with a
    25-year warranty.

    title: "Do I need a battery storage system?",
    description: `
      While a battery storage system is not required, it can be beneficial
      for storing excess energy generated during the day for use at night or
      during power outages. Batteries can also help you become more energy
      independent.
